## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_  

The reason I chose this idea/project was to address the increasing need for effective remote collaboration tools. With teams distributed across different locations, I aimed to create a simple and user-friendly document editor where multiple users can seamlessly collaborate on a document in real-time. This project leverages real-time updates to enhance communication and productivity, allowing users to work together without barriers.
