## Project Title
**CollabWrite: Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor**

## Project Description
During the hackathon, I built **CollabWrite**, a real-time collaborative document editor that allows multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously. Users can create, edit, and format text in real-time, with changes reflected instantly across all collaborators. The platform also supports document versioning, allowing users to retrieve and review past versions.

## Inspiration behind the Project
The project was inspired by the need for more effective remote collaboration tools, especially for teams working from different locations. I wanted to build a simple, user-friendly document editor where collaboration is seamless and hassle-free, leveraging the power of real-time updates to enable multiple users to work on the same document together.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** Appwrite (Database)
- **Real-time collaboration:** WebSockets
- **Version Control:** Appwrite's Realtime and Storage Services

## Usage of Appwrite
- **Appwrite Database:** For storing and managing document metadata and content.
- **Appwrite Authentication:** For handling user registration, login, and authentication processes.
- **Appwrite Storage:** Used to store document files and manage version histories.
- **Appwrite Realtime:** To synchronize document changes in real-time across users.

## Anything Else You Want To Share With Us?
Looking forward, I plan to add more features to **CollabWrite**, such as offline support, code syntax highlighting, and integrated voice/video call functionality to enhance real-time collaboration. Building this project was a fantastic experience that allowed me to explore Appwrite's features and build a tool aimed at solving real-world collaboration challenges!
